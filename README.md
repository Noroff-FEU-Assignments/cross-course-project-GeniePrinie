This is a Home page of Rainydays, an online clothing store website.

## Description

This project was to create an online jacket store. It was also to make a functional shopping cart, create my own REST API by using the WordPress Woocommerce plug-in, and make a validation form for the contact form. The site was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript making a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch the data. 

### The pages are:

1. Home Page
2. Women Page
3. Jackets Page (where all the products are)
4. Specific Jacket Page (an individual jacket page when clicked a product from the Jackets Page)
5. Shopping Cart Page (where you can see all your products and prices that you are going to purchase. You can add/remove any products from the cart)
6. Checkout pages:

   1. Information Page (where the customer can fill out the information about themselves)
   2. Payment Page (where the customer can fill out their card numbers and pay)
   3. Thank you Page (where the customer can see the summery of what they buy and other info)

7. About Page (this is a page of what the website is about)
8. Contact Page (where the customers can fill the form and contact the storeowner regarding for any topics)

### This website includes:

- Local storage (add/remove jackets from the shopping cart)
- Rest API from Wordpress (get the products from the API)
- Functional contact form
- Hamburger menu for the phone-view
- Basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## WordPress

The WordPress was installed on my web host a add the blogs on the admin panel. The content for the website are stored on a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS. WordPress is only used to provide an API and add content for the blog. 

The JavaScript code makes a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch the data (recipes).

## Hotjar

Hotjar was installed on the website. I asked users to test my website, and adjust based on their feedback and any insights from Hotjar.
